Flashcard App - Japanese Kana Learning

About the Project:
-------------------
This is a simple flashcard application developed in Python to help users learn Japanese Kana (Hiragana and Katakana). 
The app asks users to identify the correct Romaji (romanized spelling) for each Kana character, level by level.

Project Features:
------------------
- Learn Hiragana or Katakana based on your choice.
- 5 Levels, each containing 10 questions.
- 3 Mistakes allowed per level.
- 90% accuracy required to unlock the next level.
- Randomized question order to make learning challenging.
- Friendly messages and feedback on answers.

Project Structure:
-------------------
- main.py            -> Main application file.
- hiragana.csv       -> CSV file containing Hiragana characters and their Romaji.
- katakana.csv       -> CSV file containing Katakana characters and their Romaji.
- README.md          -> This file, describing the project.

How to Run:
------------
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Place 'main.py', 'hiragana.csv', and 'katakana.csv' in the same folder.
3. Open a terminal (cmd or PowerShell).
4. Navigate to the project folder.
5. Run the following command:
   
   python main.py

Important Notes:
