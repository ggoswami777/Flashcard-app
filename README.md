## 📘 Project 1: Japanese Flashcard App

### ✅ Description
A simple Python-based flashcard application to help users **learn Japanese vocabulary**.  
Each flashcard displays an English word and waits for user input to reveal the corresponding **Japanese meaning**.

### ⚙️ Features
- Command-line interface (CLI)
- Interactive flashcard flipping
- Japanese-English word pairs stored in a dictionary or file
- Random word selection for practice
- Easy to expand or convert into GUI/website later

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3
- `random` module (for word selection)
- File I/O or dictionaries (to store flashcard data)

### 🚀 How to Run

python flashcardappjapanese.py
make sure to have hiragana.csv,katakana.csv and flashcardappjapanese.py in same file


## Project 2 : Madlibs

# 📝 Python MadLibs Generator

This is a fun command-line **MadLibs generator** built using Python. The project randomly selects a story template and fills in the blanks based on user input to create a unique, funny narrative every time.

## 🔧 How It Works

- The `sample_madlib` folder contains multiple story files like `hungergames.py`, `zombie.py`, and helper files like `code.py` and `hp.py`.
- `madlibs.py` serves as the main runner, importing story functions and randomly picking one.
- Each MadLib prompts the user to enter words (like nouns, adjectives, etc.) and generates a filled story.

# Project 3: Guess The Number Game
# 🎯Guess The Number Game


A simple and fun number guessing game built in Python!  
You can choose to guess a number yourself, or let the computer guess the number you're thinking of.

## 📁 File

- `guessthenumber.py` – Main game file

## 🚀 Features

- Two game modes:
  - Player guesses the number
  - Computer guesses your number
- Replay option after each game
- Interactive command-line interface

## ▶️ How to Run
python guessthenumber.py


# Project 4: Rock Paper Scissors Game 🎮

## ✅ Description
A terminal-based Rock Paper Scissors game where players compete against the computer. Features randomized AI moves, score tracking, and a clean CLI interface.

## ⚙️ Features
- Interactive command-line gameplay
- Randomized computer choices
- Score tracking (Best of 3/5 rounds)
- Input validation (Handles invalid moves)
- Easy to expand (Add lizard/spock variants later)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3
- `random` module (for AI moves)
- Basic loops and conditionals

## 🚀 How to Run

python rock_paper_scissors.py



# 🚀 Project 5: Hangman Game (Python Mini Project)

This is a simple command-line Hangman game written in Python. The player tries to guess a randomly selected word by guessing one letter at a time, with a limited number of wrong attempts allowed.

---

## 📁 Files Included

- **`hangman.py`** – The main script that contains the game logic.
- **`words.py`** – A separate file that includes a list of words used in the game.

---

## 📄 Example `words.py`

Make sure your `words.py` looks something like this:


words = ["python", "hangman", "developer", "function", "variable", "keyboard"]
