## 📘 Project 1: Japanese Flashcard App

### ✅ Description
A simple Python-based flashcard application to help users **learn Japanese vocabulary**.  
Each flashcard displays an English word and waits for user input to reveal the corresponding **Japanese meaning**.

### ⚙️ Features
- Command-line interface (CLI)
- Interactive flashcard flipping
- Japanese-English word pairs stored in a dictionary or file
- Random word selection for practice
- Easy to expand or convert into GUI/website later

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3
- `random` module (for word selection)
- File I/O or dictionaries (to store flashcard data)

### 🚀 How to Run

python flashcardappjapanese.py
make sure to have hiragana.csv,katakana.csv and flashcardappjapanese.py in same file

I will keep adding more Python projects including:

*Logic-building games
*AI/ML mini tools
*Web integrations
Stay tuned and ⭐️ the repo if you find it useful!
